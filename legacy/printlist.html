 If you want to choose what information you'd like to see on your printable list, follow the steps below:

<ol>
<li>Read these steps</li>
<li>Close this pop-up screen, NOT THE WHOLE SPREADSHEET</li>
<li>Navigate to the print list tab, you can find this on the bottom of the spreadsheet</li>
<li>Once you're on the print list tab, select the information you want from the dropdowns on the first row.</li>
<li>If the information you want to print is not listed here, 
it means this information was not a question in your google form. 
Unfortunately this spreadsheet is not clairvoyant, it can only give you info you asked it to collect.</li>
<li>You can then print the list by going to file>print in the top navigation. </li>
